Version: 5.1.018.177624777

The most stable in my view is the camera. The photos are saturated and there is not such a huge number of settings as in other modes.
#### The main functions are:
• Zooming in portrait mode is customizable.
• Fix departure / stupid in the sun.
• HDR + settings are present and fully functional.
• Works Portrait mode from the box.
• Optimal settings for the main camera.
• Signing the application com.google.android.GoogleCamera.
• The optimal set of settings in the item under our device immediately from the box.

#### 01.15.2019g.
• Due to frequent calls to me, due to frequent camera drops when clicking on the lower bar, I had to remove this function, but the item is still on the way
• Additional camera settings-HDR + auto-exposure mode.
• Added new item "Increased detail" in portrait mode.
• Added an item with a link to the author of the camera in Telegram, if you have any preferences, then write there ...
• Fixed zoom on the front camera.
Returned the original version of the application 5.1.018.177624777.
